Hello, I'm Xue Jing  (薛婧 in Chinese). Welcome to my homepage! \
I am a first year Master student at the Shanxi University of Finance and Economics, majoring in Applied Statistics. Currently, I am doing research about Bayesian Machine Learning supervised by [A.P Junming Li](http://tj.sxufe.edu.cn/info/1296/2430.htm).
